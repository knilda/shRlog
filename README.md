Security Hub in R using Graylog

An overview of firewall log data in R via Shiny App

This is the first version of the App. 
We select data from the last 6 hours of a graylog stream. 

First run data_last_hours.R file in the folder shinyApp/overview_app first to get the data. Then open server.R and press the "Run App"-Button. 

I am open for any Questions, so please ask.
